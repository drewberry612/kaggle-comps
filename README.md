# 🎯 Practice for Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository showcases my ongoing practice and exploration of **data science** and **machine learning** through Kaggle competitions. I engage in these challenges in my free time to sharpen my skills and stay updated with the latest in the field.

## ✅ What I Do in These Competitions

In each Kaggle competition, I approach the challenge as a miniature data science project. The typical process includes:

1. **Understanding the Problem**  
   I begin by reading the competition description and understanding the objective — whether it's classification, regression, ranking, etc. I also try to understand what kind of real-world scenario the data represents.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
   I perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, spot anomalies, and guide preprocessing. This often involves:
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Creating new features from existing ones  

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   I experiment with multiple models (e.g. logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting), using:
   - Cross-validation to assess generalisation  
   - Hyperparameter tuning via grid/random search or Optuna  

4. **Submission and Iteration**  
   Once I have a promising model, I generate predictions for the test set and submit to Kaggle. I track public leaderboard scores and iterate accordingly.

5. **Result Interpretation**  
   After the competition or submission phase, I analyse:
   - What worked and what didn’t  
   - The impact of specific features  
   - Model performance trade-offs
